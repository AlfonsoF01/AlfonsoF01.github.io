## Overview

Short one-paragraph summary: what the project is and the main result.

## Problem statement

Explain the engineering challenge you addressed (constraints, requirements, metrics).

## Approach

* Hardware: list the components (microcontroller, sensors, actuators).
* Software: summarize algorithms used (SLAM, path planning, controllers).
* Key design decisions and why.

## Results

Show quantitative results (tables, bullet points) and qualitative (photos, GIFs, video links).

Example:

* Navigation success rate: **92%** across 10 test runs.
* Mean path error: **0.35 m**.
